# WIP

## Development

#### Compile HTML/CSS/JS assets

```sh
yarn dev
```

Runs `webpack` under the hood along with `babel` to compile the menu bar application JS. The UI itself is handled by `react`.

Keep this running in the background or a tab while you dev.

#### Start the Electron application

```sh
yarn start
```

Start the application locally on your machine.
